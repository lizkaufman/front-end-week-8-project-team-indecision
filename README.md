# #NeedATree - Mid-term project for School of Code

I worked in a team of four to produce a full-stack React/Express project for the West Midlands Combined Authority over a week-long agile sprint with daily stand-ups and regular check-ins.
I designed functional React components and state logic behind them as well as fetch requests that fed the information from these components into the PostgreSQL database tables. I also used CSS grid and media queries to make responsive tablet and mobile versions.
